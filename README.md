CIFRA has 3 types of game modes: Dash, King and Sum.

## Dash

Dash use the blank faces of pieces. 
It's very simple race game. The Game goal is to move more of your own pieces to the opposite side than your opponent. 

## King

King is simple fight game to capture your opponent's King or to move your own King to opposite side first.  
Since there are two game strategies you must change tactics throughout the game.

## Sum

Sum is basically a race game but you must consider the pieces value(number). The game goal is to obtain more total score of goal pieces than your opponent. So, Even though a player may have fewer goal piece(s) than their opponent, if he/she gets higher total score than opponent, then they win the game.

Players place their pieces blank side at first on the starting line, when game starts they reveal their number faces. Players must think about a deeper strategy considering placement and value of their pieces.
